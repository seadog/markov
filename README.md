About
=====
Markov is a library for creating and using markov chains in java.

Requirements
============
Building markov requires buildr to be installed (gem install buildr should be enough), the rest of the dependencies are automatically downloaded and installed to your local maven repository.

Installation
============
Simply run buildr install and all the dependencies and markov will be installed.

Run
===
The default Main class of markov can be run with a data.txt file in the current directory to create a markov chain out of each line (which is assumed to be a sentence), and then to output a single sentence generated by the chain as output.
